Repository for Computer Hardware Course: labs, notes, and projects for learning electronics, assembly, and troubleshooting.”
Computer Hardware Course 2025

This repository tracks my progress through a 6-module Computer Hardware course, from electronics basics to advanced overclocking. It includes lab results, notes, cheat sheets, Python scripts, and infographics for hands-on learning.

Structure





module1_electronics: Labs (e.g., Ohm’s Law), multimeter readings.



module2_components: Component specs (e.g., CPU-Z outputs).



module3_assembly: PC build guides, photos.



module4_troubleshooting: Diagnostic logs (e.g., POST errors).



module5_advanced: RAID, virtualization setups.



module6_optimization: Overclocking tests, benchmarks.



scripts: Python scripts (e.g., voltage calculations).



cheat_sheets: Key tables (e.g., resistor codes).



reflections: Weekly summaries.



infographics: Visuals (e.g., circuit diagrams).
